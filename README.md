### Cancer Gene Expression Data Analysis with Autoencoder Feature Extraction
This project explores the application of autoencoder models in the analysis of cancer gene expression data. The goal is to leverage autoencoder architecture to perform feature extraction from gene expression data, facilitating downstream analysis such as cancer classification, subtype identification, or prognosis prediction.

# Overview
Autoencoder Models: Various autoencoder architectures are implemented and trained on cancer gene expression datasets to learn a compressed representation of the input data.

Feature Extraction: The bottleneck layer of the trained autoencoder models serves as a feature extractor, capturing essential information from the high-dimensional gene expression data.

Cancer Gene Expression Data: Publicly available datasets containing gene expression profiles of cancer samples are utilized for training and evaluation.

# Key Features
